# Hybrid-Privacy-Preserving-Deep-Learning
Hybrid Privacy-Preserving Deep Learning is an encryption method that secures the information in the image.

Hybrid Privacy-Preserving Deep Learning is based on Homomorphic Encryption(HE), specifically Partially Homomorphic Encryption(PHE) and Somewhat Homomorphic Encryption(SHE). 

As the encryption approach is a trade-off between data privacy and model accuracy, DLaaS can run on encrypted images without any enemy user being to know the context of the images and due to Hybrid_PPDL's ability to preserve the feature of images, DL Models can train on this type of images and show an accuracy result.
